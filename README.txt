The Idea
We wanted to create an easy to use "toolbox", for even not so tech savvy users, enabling just anyone to build their own led dashboards and lights. We started off with the particle.io ecosystem, simply because it is exceptionally easy to use and requires no programming or embedded hardware knowledge for you to get started.
For the more tech savvy people also support the WLED firmware.
